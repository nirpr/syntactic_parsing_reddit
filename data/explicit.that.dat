the way 415 discussion works is that they post a worksheet online in advance, and they ask you to complete it, though it's not required.

warlocks are the only ones who can claim that their schizophrenia gives them superpowers!
no, i don't believe that you need this
just remember that they are the silly ones though, for they apparently have a lot of nothing to say, so much nothing, in fact, that they are more than happy to size it all down to two words for you!
