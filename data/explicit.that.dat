they're all wonderful people and i'd be willing to bet that they can help you manage yourself and either get back to where you need to be, or find someone else who can help you get the therapy that can really help you to get back on your feet.

when the subreddit continues to grow and we feel that we need help from others, we will make a post letting everyone know about mod openings.

as such, doing internships (too late for that now) or doing side projects show that you have an eagerness to learn.

true that, but we did only see a part of the timewar, so we could still assume that all the other things did happen.

so....that would indicate that he knew where their country of origin was.

and who are you the proud lord said that i must wear my coat?

we all saw that it took a few games for tank lawrence to really get involved in the defense last year.

i'm not well versed but recently i read summaries of some us laws that dictate that you must attempt to escape an assailant before fighting back for it to legally qualify as self-defense.

are you saying that there are cowboys fans who aren't irrationally overhyping their roster?

i think the idea is that a durable space suit would have to have the ability to self-seal a puncture, since there's tons of small debris flying around.

i more just meant that i'd be disappointed that brandon's new homework and the vocalist's post weren't in relation to the recording of a new album, rather than i'd expect anything released in the next month to be for a new album.

considering that i waited outside in the rain for a bus for 40 minutes to avoid a 20 minute walk, i kinda get the appeal

i'll try that next time i encounter the issue, thanks.

i don't need recognition - knowing that i can kick ass at something makes me feel awesome.

what's messed up is, when confronted, they said that they weren't told that virtual farms weren't covered and they are taking their "case" to court.

there is criticism of some obama policies however reddit is generally liberal and a majority will agree with much that obama has done.

you mean that there are all kinds of different people with all kinds of different opinions and just because someone holds one opinion about one issue doesn't mean they hold an entire belief system?

personally i find that it happens as much to women as to men.

note that both, *request* and *reply* should be manually written by you.

eventually realized that i didn't like doing academic research.

i was just saying that i put 500 hours into this game.

it's almost certain that every object has its own pocket dimension inside the pouch, so they don't interact with each other.

i get that it sucks.

i thought it was a rule at the strip clubs that doing anything with your "big no-no" was crossing a line.

why is it so ridiculous that that could result in finding different relaxation/hobby activities enjoyable?

once they figure the team change out, i think that they will come out on top.

and they often insist that they are typing the password perfectly and their laptops just aren't taking the password.

this is not true, the vast majority of studies imply that there is no correlation between increased cancer rates and cellphone usage.

i would assume that their "language" has more in common with morse code then english.

i think i get what you are saying, but here's the thing: all this says you don't trust her (and really i still don't get the vibe that you respect her all that much either).

don’t judge me here for noticing but can anyone else tell that only three people in this elevator are wearing underwear?

"contrary to the narrative promoted by the new york times, the data suggests that youtube’s recommendation algorithm actively discourages viewers from visiting content that one could categorize as radicalizing or otherwise questionable."

if one of you develops uti symptoms, be sure to let your doctor know that you likely contracted it through anal sex, since utis in adult men are so rare otherwise that they’d probably want to test you for any kidney or bladder anatomical defects.

rainmeter actually has a built in feature to do exactly that in rainmeter.ini you can add this:

the most confusing part for me was he’s saying “okay this is a good starting point” as if he didn’t realize that he *had to respond or counter in order to get to the next point*

first round diagnostics says its either my psu or my mobo that's shot, and i kind of don't want to try the first and realize that it means i need to replace *everything*.

not to mention that there are so many different items that it's basically impossible to put a hard price on a lot of them.

man said his name was elmer, made no other comments besides saying that he had recently given up wabbit hunting.

dwarves would surely still be underground miners, because you might have noticed that our society relies on mining an awful lot

again, i was responding to op's claim that, as someone who lives in the area, he had heard this might be the case.

i have no idea what chris cooper is up to, but i know that he's got a defamation case against that blog you linked for naming him "an agent of the russian government" without evidence.

i agree that it doesn't help anyone to make life miserable for white people, but (and if you think this opinion is naive, please tell me) i don't think that that's what most people campaigning against privilege actually want.

i didn't realize that there was a square hole pattern so that should work.

i think it would be cumbersome to try and get the audience to know that you were labeling the armor as something as well as labeling the character as something else.

i lived in saudi arabia briefly; it certainly isn't perfect by any means but not this women hating state that everybody thinks it is.

it is certainly a stretch to say that i hate mentally disabled people based on the fact that i posted a video from a relatively popular youtuber.

don’t you see it, you can’t even stand someone saying that you could improve.

there is a fantastic theory **spoiler**    that they all died in the plane crash, and the survivors were just the souls of the people who haven't accepted death yet.

he was talking about twitter’s statistics and that they show that right wingers are much more likely to follow left wingers on twitter than vice versa.

the developer should know that they are selling their product outside of steam, and hopefully would develop the multiplayer with that in minde...

that mombie should know -- after all, she is one.

basically the kings' front office decided that they were going to take stauskas so they called him up to tell him and part of their conversation was having the whole war room yell "nik rocks!"

if he believed that he didn't have to report it, then that line is not technically a lie.

this only became a gender issue when the op singled out men and stated that their behavior bothers her.

would you have preferred that we started colt for 8 games then he gets injured again and we have to resort to a sanchez or josh johnson?

having less people hang onto their student status in order to make ends meet as well as keep their enrollment status also means that they graduate sooner, so you'll ideally have less competition for coveted classes.

sign of the times: i find it scary that i'm actually agreeing with karl rove!!

after hearing what leffen said on his stream, i have to admit that he kinda has a point.

i was shocked to see it, but even more shocked to realize that i knew it without googling.

we have to remember that we have something like 50000000000 neurons and 150000000000000 axons/dendrites.

in reverse of that also ensure that they respect your position as dm, in the game your word is law.

i kind of bought that there were other places on kaladesh that ghirapur traded with.

the problem is that i'm so fucked up in my head that i can't even trust that i actually feel bad.

on the other hand, i have no reason to expect that the person touching me understands that they are violating my sexual autonomy, so i will react to that violation as an act of ignorance, not an act of malice.

if german were a global lingua franca, i doubt that i would speak more than one foreign language, if any.

that means that there are 10 franchises with less desirable tv markets.

now he's like kassadin in the sense that he wants to fight the void.

you can talk about that all you want, that maybe he doesn't actually mean a democratic socialist but instead a social democrat or something like that, but the fact remains that he still refers to himself as a socialist.

basically, they thought that when you would get an almost perfect item, like perfect in every way but one stat, you would go "oh man, so close!

the point is that he is treating her with zero respect when they hook up.

edit: i wrote a reply saying that doing a quick interview on ellen can mean a small and paid-for vacation (travel, lodging, spending money, and possibly meet some interesting celebrities, etc...).

we don't know that he actually died though.

they clearly realize that they can force everyone to pay $60 and purchase both games, and double their sales numbers and profit.

while i doubt that it's gonna make any sort of significant improvement (because core m), would an optane drive potentially solve the ram constraints?

i want to say that they made fcs fairly recently in the last few decades.

still the problem of everything else i said that you won't talk about.

true, but it was one of the 5 ways to score that mario did against us that one time.

the pay will be about the same but i don't believe that i will enjoy it at much as the job that i just started, should i purposefully have a borderline interview vs a stellar one?

i read that if he "knows how it ends" that he totally loses interest.

edit: i should add that i do not like to learn from watching other players, but some people do.

i think that i've seen them in hotels as far back as 15 years ago.

i think it's worth noting that a huge portion of an entire lineage of jews was destroyed by the nazi death machine as well.

is it so hard to believe that they wouldn't adopt and refine a blade design from a people they conquered?

hos parents eventually confess that he's adopted and give him the royal sword he was to inherit on his 18th birthday.

you think that we actually have a budget of 45m to work with instead?

i remember that i found a full stash of magazines one time.

it feels good to suggest that everyone in every shitty, low-demand, low-skill job in the world should make a "living wage," but the reality is that's not the case.

if the deer doesn't feel in danger it may just lay there in an attempt to "rest" not realizing that it's dying, but if you approach then it'll feel in danger and may try to fight or escape.

recant--say that one no longer holds an opinion or belief, especially one considered heretical.

i'm just saying that you can put a diaper on a dog for a legitimate reason

its good that you bring up the cooling, cause i didnt know that my room is regularly pretty warm.

to the point one of my professors pulled me aside and said she was a little concerned about hearing that i'd been having orgy parties at my apartment.

for a second there i thought you said that high school teaches you how to learn.

the episode of black mirror with the bees has convinced me that this will happen in the next 50 years.

yeah but i think that one did not have widespread violence.

i felt that i should share it.

i mean, i never claimed to say that i did.

the iranian government, the iaea, and recently leaked documents from cia and mossad say that they want nuclear plants for peaceful purposes, to power their many large cities in a more efficient and environmentally-friendly way.

whatever the causes of these disorders, the fact remains that anyone contemplating a homosexual lifestyle should have no illusions about what he is getting into.

which i'll admit is hurtful, but i like to think that at least my peers (college students mostly) don't really care one way or another about trans people, as long as they don't get annoying about their pronouns.

"do you realize that you are looking at a man who has never tied his own shoes?"

vaporization does not mean that something's gone in particle physics.

only after seeing a few post-race onboards have i realised that it was actually raining a reasonable amount, and not just at the hairpin.

and you'll all lap it up by presuming that we're doing it to make it better for your platform when in actuality we're just lazy bastards who hate your platformmmmmm^m^^m^^^m" with the voice of the sales guy in family guy.

by saying that you just lost every last drop of credibility you had left, shitbag.

sorry, i meant that he never adds anything of value to the scenes he's in aside from being the plot device that moves story forward.

i would be lying if i didn't add that i went to treatment first.

i can tell already that i will have to remain patient while i learn more about how her illness affects her.

i don't know that i'd call myself a fan, but they make some damn good music now.

the person who he said he was mooning said that he wasn't mooned and peyton lied.

taking that as implying that i haven't even *read* the other half is disingineous at best.

you know, i always just assumed that they had spilled something in their ice-bucket, and just put it in the urinal to dispose of it?

actually, now that i think about it, i think i might want champ instead of browner.

* okay, that first part might not work out so well, but you've gotta make sure he knows where he stands.

i'm agnostic/atheistic and i don't believe that we all descended from a guy named adam.

you aren't told to care that it's been going on for 20+ years.

that's why i've deleted write access to my server from my laptop, so that if i do unfortunately get this shit my data will be saved.

i still don't like that we got rid of de sanctis.

no, spontaneous means that there is *no* cause, eg, the spontaneous decay of radioactive particles.

good to know that he got his dinner, makes that jump even better!

yes, the best gear isn't stock, but ben has said many times that we can buy insurance to cover upgrades.

luckily his work puts me on private healthcare in the uk, so dad took me to the general practitioner, who agreed that i should have a precautionary mri-scan.

yes, of course, but it's rare enough that i'm assuming it's not what happened here.

this is a very common ploy on such websites - some going even further and "openly" stating that they employ people to entertain customers.

just know that you may go a long time without getting your needs met unless you ask for what you want.

note that i would be shocked if that were to happen.

ren &amp; stimpy was great, but that isn't the main point of this comment, i wish that they would just make a reddit-wide ban for the goddamn puffin meme already.

my wife and my all white chihuahua are going to hate that you made me aware of this product

by the way, smart ass, you ought to know i was talking about before we left - i assume that you already knew that but wanted all the ammunition you could find because you know nothing about iraq.

i don't know if we can assume that it was opened in '73, but we can probably assume that's around the time the original animatronics were made.

but i still don't think it's fair to say that our society just lets these kids do whatever without any consequence.

actually i'm happy to say that it worked out pretty good.

but empire implies that we have direct control of the administration of massive parts of the world, which we don't.

they probably don't even know that they're dating or on a date lol

i kind of find that janelle monáe has a similar energy as dennis but her music is very different.

i was kinda hoping that it wouldn't resurface.

do you think that it can help with improving or doesn't or maybe it doesn't matter.

that's not a large number to some, and i can't say that i feel it is either, but it is a respectable number nonetheless.

but i just get bored and hope that there's someone interesting outside to talk to.

it's been widely speculated that it is based on the market value of the player.

i mostly remember that i just couldn't get used to the bioshock controls.

you obviously have no plans to actually understand the concept behind anakin or anything in the prequels and you fail to realize that i have no plans to ever consider what you are saying about them.

at what point does satire become so accurate that it loops back around to cringe?

i'm pretty sure the catholic church even has an edict that says that science doesn't contradict the bible, it merely changes our understanding of god's message.

i've been playing with an idea that there were 2 more students at the school that day- honour students that hide out of earshot and diss the original 5 as posers, while also talking about the pressures to become "the &lt;somebody&gt;" in society.

this means that your highest of 230 with 9 items, is most likely averaging out at around 236 or so with just the 7 items.

i said that there's no guarantee that person is praising ye today, because he's a very polarizing figure.

i'll agree that i preferred the easier to get borderlands 1 legendaries, as i'm not much of a grinder, but that really can't be used to bring down the second one.

"initial quality" wtf kind of bullshit award is that, to me that means, as long as its less than a year old you're good...i'd like to keep my car for more than a year

i know it is petty, but it is constant joy to think that my neighborhood thugs handed yankee soldiers their own asses on the plate.

isn’t it ironic how you’re trying to say that you don’t care about upvotes but you mention it in all three of your comments in this chain

wish that they increased ft to 3 lp or increased it's ammo cost.

so you're saying that he get's offended every time he hears a black dude call another black dude "nigga"?

but, i am saying that virtually nothing in that sequence took me out of the moment.

i was under the impression that it was using ip recognition to prevent multiple votes.

we have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that this nation might live.

i think it's odd that the makers of the game could grossly misunderstand the essence of the fucking game they're making, even though it has more than one template to base itself off.

for some reason, mylolname decided that this should imply that for any number *x*:  ...which is not true in all cases (or most of them, actually).

i have no problem admitting that i have the weirdest boner right now.

how should i know that it changed my life forever when it was not even 48 hours ago?

i don't think you understand this situation, it's a mental disorder, i also think that you should not make a joke about something unless you know what you are joking about, as in you know exactly how autism can affect a person, or if you yourself has that condition.

in my head, i feel that i ended our friendship fairly.

it's depressing to let someone go on believing an utter falsity and at the same time knowing that that person is potentially going to vote, raise children, or convince other people of his/her falsities.

i think we both know that if the picture on the right was *anything* else then this post wouldn't have gotten upvotes anyway, i'm going to go back to teabagging people irl

having said that i don't begrudge those that do hire prostitutes in order to get it over with.

i don't know how to prove that my sister and i are starving aside from showing you the stete of our fridge and pantry.

i hope she does return soon, and that there is really no ill feelings involved between fnc, choa and the rest of aoa.

the march madness games had that ooc feature back in the ps2 days.

but he's also hiding out of shame for how badly he feels he screwed up: he's not ready to go and face kylo ren again, he's still not good enough, and he's convinced that if he tries to bring the jedi back again now he'll just fail again.

guy comes in the next day to pay back my friend the 2 bucks or whatever and learned that he was canned from another employee.

the black bay is so glossy and glinty and curvy that no one picture seems to do a good job of capturing how the light interacts with it.

but, she cannot deny that her boss gave up her job that day because of us.

now this i can get into, i hate that it sticks up.

same reason buskers throw a couple of bucks in their guitar case... so that people see they're taking donations and see that 'others' gave bills instead of change.

ya know , the cruel march of time and that nobody can escape the ever-closer hand of death.also spiders and other bugs

but obi-wan didn't fight the senate, and yoda soon learned that you can't cleave the sheev in a normal 1v1.

it usually means that more of your energy is focused in that house.

somebody (on here actually) showed that they are still losing in competitive games as well.

it seemed to me that they were telling what happened and letting the viewer decide who sucked and who didn’t.

if a war is so ridiculously destructive that we lose any significant portion of the population such that that would be even a remote worry, we are already fucked beyond belief.

i mentioned that he left out "of the people", and suggested he do some reading on the national firearms act, gun control act, and fopa before making inaccurate statements.

so not only is there the chance that you will recall something incorrectly, but there is also a very large chance your brain won't even notice and will declare it accurate.

warlocks are the only ones who can claim that their schizophrenia gives them superpowers!

yeah, but complaining that complaining that your speed run doesn't pay off in 2 days of runs is complete bullshit.

mmm good question, slower no, but is frequent that i cannot remember the word on spanish, but i know the word on english (for an object or an action for example)

many just don't like his tactics and others don't like that he seemingly doesn't have an answer for our league woes.

correct if i'm mistaken, but these restrictions would imply that children, regular immigrants, and anyone else is isn't working/contributing immediately should not have access to care.

or did they find that they can't progress after they return for an unknown reason.

that pissed me off so much that charles and logan agreed to go anywhere with those people knowing it would certainly mean their deaths.

i noticed today that danny has green eyes as well.

you are telling them that if they fail to do what is responsible, you got their back

you're running off the false assumption that he was attacking gaming.

you fault him for being insecure that his wife broke his heart may only have come back because was lonely?

however, that does not mean that i supported the patriot act and all of the government spying on its own citizens that occurred afterwards.

i remember i used to drive a truck through the california central valley, and get really annoyed with people who came onto the freeway seemingly without checking until the last second that "oh my god there's a giant truck next to me!"

this community highlights thing is really cool, and i hope that we'll see it continuing in the future!

when i play on the us servers (i'm in the uk), which i do most of the time, i do notice that i'll sometimes lose a 1 on 1 gunfight when i feel i should have won it.

i do believe that people get smarter over time, yes, i have seen many idiots growing up to be responsible adults.

if it looked like that i hope it would still only move its head when using a move.

it makes me laugh that all of the people who i once hear say something 'to grow up', wanted to go back young again... oh ho ho the futility of their efforts to enjoy life is so unfortunate, yet entertaining to see...

it s no longer expected that we keep silent.

so for the officer to testify that he saw the key in the ignition meant he was lying under oath, or committing perjury.

when you meet with your teacher, specify that you want to learn theory so that you can improv better, in addition to techniques to sound more musical.

i know that if you smile at somebody and they smile back, you’ve just decided that something shitty is going to happen.

for me it's realizing that i have to go back to my hellhole job on monday until i have another job.

if the description says that it'll work on my device then i expect it to work - "you have an outdated device" are only excuses for ripping me off.

that photo makes it look like he's in pain trying to smile.

people forgot that people have been speculating that they would release a collab album for this joint tour.

i think with trump we also realized that there are wide swaths of people out there who held their noses or stayed home when romney/bush/mccain was standing up there talking about not regulating the "job creators" and flaunting their wealthy, connected backgrounds.

believe me in saying that nothing was stopping them, i remember my freshman year someone went and looked at her dorm, hated it and then decided not to move her stuff in and withdrew from the school.

many people actually believe that disney 'owns' it.

positive: it means you are good looking negative: it means that whoever called you it doesn’t think of you as tough or a roll up your sleeves kind of a guy.

at the very least, it shows that you take great pride in your work and you seemed to have enjoyed it.

she got a double dose of depression because her first boyfriend, that she had lost her virginity to (at 19), was a total tool and cheated on her *with her roommate* and she walked in on it.

i assume the worst case scenario- it will not be a mythic and that i will open the jankiest of rares.

who else can say that they had danced on a whale?

but op states that he and his spouse cumulatively make at least $200,000 per year.

------------------------------ edit: new developments: it is indeed compatible but seems that it ships without the necessary firmware.

saying "it's possible yo stfu about the politics for a couple of days" is the most cowardly, indecent, privileged point of view i can imagine in the given context, because it implies that there were people who didn't have the basis of their existence threatened by john mccain.

his argument was that by secretly doing it, it would encourage the daughter to continue using condoms.

since it had been a few years since the romulans and klingons became adversaries it would be safe to say that both had evolved the technologies since that point.

assuming that you actually have a life, that's going to double at least.

"* good thing that the guy who last worked on it a year ago is gone.

if you really are dating someone who is considered a celebrity, i hope that you understand that this is for your own good.

but then every search engine just tells you "i see that you put this in quotations, but what you're looking up is stupid so i'll just show you how to reset your password".

if it isn't that you still might have a problem with your mod.

i always try to do this, especially if it was difficult to set up -- just to show i appreciate that they're putting effort into the friendship, yaknow?

i think we all can agree that there's too many people ranting about the show, and of course those who use the "monty card" are straight up idiots.

i really hope it's ai that *learns* from the way you fight and trains with you so something like this is possible.

specifically, i like that my verbs have only tenses, no number, and i like that my language has a lot of "understood" or default bits like the "you understood" in english commands.

i was donating this morning (tried, anyway, one of my veins didn't cooperate) and the rep told me that a lot of supplies are going to puerto rico and the islands lately.

(i've learned that i eat out more than i should after having so many f'ing stories) but there was a real bitch of a woman one time that was ordering and she was loud.

whats nottheonion, the fact that arthur had a gay wedding or that alabama wont air it

note that you shouldn't reward people for leaving you frustrated, or else they're likely to do it again.

not my type of game but i can't deny that this looks very impressive.

i hate that i always have to take seasickness pills and sit high up when i go the theaters now.

hey i never said that we should be spending less.

i didn’t really understand that they had no decent army, and that their nuclear program was more for show, but it still scared me.

but you're right, if it's anything like beric then he will be more or less the same jon (although they do remark that you 'lose something' every time you come back).

i suggested that he make the accessory a drop down instead.

the difference is that you believe that it can't improve and that a separate uk policy is automatically better; i don't.

american sports focus on parity, which means that in order to succeed, you do so through good management.

edit: you kids can impulse down-vote me as much as you want; however, seeing that we're having a pedantic discussion about what constitutes as theft and what isn't, my comment above is a fact.

i saw an article on fox news that said that your cat is possessed by satan.

isn't it reasonable to assume that they make at least enough profit to justify their existence to their employers?

it's not that i don't like them, it's that i can already tell i'm not going to relate to that person.

others that understand that they don't know, but get that we still feel the same.

the waaay too much emphasis on religion : i know i said that i like that some people like their religion but some people like it too much.

let’s not also forget that they explicitly said they were releasing cds.

i use emulators, and just don't care that i'm pirating.

i'm hoping that i can live in china, hong kong or taiwan after i graduate, i had so many awesome experiences in such a short time (a month and a half) and its crazy the things you can do there if you just put your mind to it.

you have to know that it's going to need either a very short respawn timer or an invulnerable period where multiple groups can tag it.

my mom was telling me about it and about 10 minutes into the conversation i realized that she was talking about my favorite bernard cornwell series.

you seem to be pointing to guys learning the basics of traditionally appropriate fit and saying that men lack variety.

you've only repeated one point: it is assumed that it will happen... but that's completely irrational.

i thought that you were asking for someone to make you a script.

people do not understand that materials act differently at high speeds.

just to indulge your "last woman on earth" scenario, i would still argue that nobody can ever ethically rape her or claim a right to control her body.

see this prank: https://youtu.be/c4yc1jktqgo?t=59 people are told that they are drinking coca cola.

yes, they are discriminated against, but neither of those sources show that they are discriminated against more so than all other groups.

i was being facetious to demonstrate that i might as well say you lose vibrations by spitting, since similarly to op's claims, there is no explanation of the mechanism of how this is supposed to happen or even what it's supposed to mean.

he came to me and said that he wanted to turn it into a subreddit that tracks all deleted posts on reddit.

but he wasn't *that* sad - he did coin the phrase "i need that like i need another hole in my head," so he had that going for him, which was nice.

i feel like if i took out my initial investment i would just start relishing that i could have reinvested it into other coins and potentially ended up with more.

your hair indicates that you think you are more interesting than you actually are.

apparently, kids these days think that when a parent or guidance counselor recommends that they go to college so they can get a good job, they mean that any college degree will get them a high paying job.

you know whats funny...i bet when you found that you were feeling really smart....didn't realize all you did was prove just how stupid you really are.

again, i may be a bit confused, but it seems to me that comparing a guy who is giving his resignation letter to a slave seems to kind of miss the point of people fighting and dying for their freedom.

we know that we have thomas and snead at wr, that our defense needs a lot of help right now, that cooks was frustrated this year because he didn't get the ball as much as he wanted, and that he's going to be due a massive contract in 2 years.

note that it says *literally*.

what if their family are real pieces of shit, always being insulting and demanding that you give them what they won't get for themselves, and neither of you want to have to deal with them?

if you're going to do something like that - and understand that in no way would i condone this - nick his battery.

well i'd argue that they should be listened to as well.

a ton of millennials support illegal immigration, even up to the illogical point of "welllll i don't support open borders, but i don't think it's right that people crossing the border should be deported."

similarly, what he's saying could mean he takes issue with the fact that he wants to implement a ubi \*or\* it could mean he takes issue with the methodology by which he plans to implement it (for instance he could not like how he plans to fund it, idk).

sure, i have a few that i don't hold any sentimental attachment to.

the person wakes up feeling totally refreshed only to realize that they'll have to face the day again... that they didn't get their wish to never wake up.

the way 415 discussion works is that they post a worksheet online in advance, and they ask you to complete it, though it's not required.

the idea is fine but the fact that it's a game means that it's necessarily scaled down, the hints at a whole world don't come through as strong because in reality those several cities are like 500m apart.

i would hope that it would help democrats a bit more than that this time around, but my understanding of politics has pretty much been turned on its head ever since 11/8/2016, so your guess is as good as mine.

as an example of my own work, i test that our app functions uniformly on win 10, win 7, macos, safari, ie 11, edge, firefox, chrome, mobile graceful degradation of ios and android, different monitor sizes/resolutions, and so on.

and now you're both agreeing that i didn't seem upset (in my first comment) but also saying i must have been upset to claim that i wasn't upset... like seriously, not even a rhetorical question, how does that make any sense at all to you?

roberts dissent (lets ignore that i read court dissents for fun just a sec.)

if any or all of the above is true (and i'm pretty sure at *least* one of them is), i assert that he's gonna have a bad time.
