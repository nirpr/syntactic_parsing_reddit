i think the general watch order is "fate/zero, unlimited blade works", but better to ask someone who's actually watched the series, haha.
makes me think it's some 90s acronym.

well, that’s if you’re happy to call 45%+ of american voters a minority i mean, technically, in political terminology, yes, it’s a minority, but if you think it’s a minority along the same lines as, say, ethnic minorities, that’ll be a lie.
ok, chalk that water one up to my arrogance believing everyone lives in the us.
besides, i don't think they would be that impressive anyway...
whooosh means you didn't get the joke as in the sound of the joke going over your head.

&amp;#x200b; &amp;#x200b; i feel you could spend days, if not weeks here, and still see cool and interesting things, but as i said our plan was an epic road trip.
i think they did for ched evan's victim as well.

i assume the worst case scenario- it will not be a mythic and that i will open the jankiest of rares.

for me (rmbp 2015): - (2019) decided i might as well get the display replaced for free as i was nearing 4 years with it -
it's just that there's a lot more opportunity for creepiness when it's "male officer/female subordinate."
--------- there is a growing trend in the "manosphere" (if i'm permitted to say that without coming across as a dirty ess-jay-dubya) that marriage is a fundamentally broken contract that seeks to ensnare the hard-earned money of hapless men everywhere when women decide they're unhappy.
i find it is a problem because pers is bankrupting the state.
if i mention that, though, i'd likely have to explain that i don't really enjoy that kind of thing in real life, it's just that it's surprisingly enjoyable to do in vr as a cute anime girl.

i wish i wasn't so quick to jump on the exotic yesterday now.
i think it is much more complicated that just favouring paying players or whatever.
but i can put the victim on the stand and ask about how dark it was, and how scared he was, and didn't he say the attacker was wearing a hood that hid part of his face, and so on.
i mean it's like; there *has* to be something because being aware of absolute nothing seems impossible, but at the same time being unaware of it just seems weird and confusing.
still, the bruins did way better than i expected they'd do this season, given where sweeney started in his tenure.

similarly, what he's saying could mean he takes issue with the fact that he wants to implement a ubi \*or\* it could mean he takes issue with the methodology by which he plans to implement it (for instance he could not like how he plans to fund it, idk).
note i'm not saying *on* it, just jump *next* to it, straight up and down.
so i can go to france and do illegal things then flee back to america claiming you can't extradite me
i can say it’s easy to remember the times people weren’t.
i thought it was pronounced like "book."
i mean it really kinda aces that test.
i'm sorry, but that's just what it comes down to for me.
big difference is the mods in game of thrones are assholes
i think we'll see an example of this when doug jones becomes a senator - republicans will be forced to pass votes with a 60 vote majority now that they've burned their 2018 reconciliation bill, and now their majority can be thwarted by just two r senators.
i mean, the solution is still valid.
*i* think it's a load of women who are tired of cat calls, and notice that some of those men who catcall in public also go to strip clubs.
i thought it was pretty insightful but i really wanted to know if it was still relevant to dota2 as it was dota?

i think you got that one wrong.
i picked out the guy i thought it was and interestingly he was found just blocks away at a bus stop, with some grass stains on his white shoes etc.

they probably just do that because they think it will provide them safety from her.
the early 4s (through early 2014) had issues with the timing chain guides failing, but again i don't think the x3 had that motor until 2013.

it doesn't really matter - even if you assume it's 100% powered by a coal power plant, it still ends up emitting roughly 66% of the co2 that a diesel bus does.
it is common knowledge that ca ids are one of the hardest to fake and considering that scannable's is getting good reviews, do you think it is more credible than an obscure state?

never said kobe isn't great just don't get why people hate when others do the same thing he did.
you love this so much you want to keep enough back to last you till you can harvest and cure more, but also you don’t want your tolerance to get too high for that specific strain, you’ll want some variety.

i thought it was usually jets, mets, and islanders and then giants, yankees and rangers fans.
your mouth should say 'oops' or something else to reflect embarrassment, but your eyes should say 'you know you want some of this'.

not restoring mana to keep poking means you have no reason to risk your safety outside that.
i'm not saying all guns should be taken from everyone; i'm saying that we should ensure that the people who do buy them have to take a gun safety class, have to pass stringent background checks, and should have to register the firearm akin to registering a car title.
i think it's kind of both
i can't remember the name but basically the idea was that we willed ourselves into existence i think it's called deism.
let them know you appreciate the fucking insanity they go through.
don't you feel it receiving slow, soft neck massages?
i'd have to look to be sure, but i'd wager they're still just .lnk files in the user's start menu in %appdata%...
sorry for thinking it was a bit different because that is absolutely the scene.
you'd think they'd find that suspicious enough to treat the encounter more seriously.
i think it's a bit odd that caravans take so much more time than it would take colonists to cross an equivalent space if zoomed in.
i think i have weakened blood flow, but it's still reliable.
he's already to a point where he'd probably throw a tantrum because you implied he was common.
if you think prejudice is somehow better than racism.
since it had been a few years since the romulans and klingons became adversaries it would be safe to say that both had evolved the technologies since that point.
i don't know man, i guess we just look at it differently.
it's not to show you love one another.
i suspect that "death grip" isn't nearly as common or as easy to develop as people think it is.

i think humans playing these games would be so much fun!
these values are assuming you're using a dual coil carto / dct mod.
i think it's first identifying where the self-sabotage is coming from.

i mentioned that he left out "of the people", and suggested he do some reading on the national firearms act, gun control act, and fopa before making inaccurate statements.
and that does mean older software won't work with the new os.
anyway, you’ve turned this into an argument about cnn (which you clearly never read, yet you think you know what their content is), and it’s clear that’s because you’re too stubborn to admit maybe you’re wrong about joe biden.

i rather thought the pertinent question was 'if'.
i hope they can back to the place they used to be.

i know chester was writing about himself, but it resonated with me because i've felt this way since i was a teenager.
i think i will go to a store and demo a couple pairs with and without anc.
i had to turn off autosave in rdr2 because every time i loaded up my saved gamed and i hit the first autosave point it would give me the "are you sure you wan to overwrite this save?"

he probably thought you were dorner.
my friends think it's a good idea to wait until later in the week for some reason.

i think we both know that if the picture on the right was *anything* else then this post wouldn't have gotten upvotes anyway, i'm going to go back to teabagging people irl
the dumbest thing in the world is to say you're better than the next person while doing the exact same thing.
as for long term plans, i think i would spend a lot of money on research and development on all sorts of stuff, ai, brain-computer interfaces, longevity research, and medicine in general, space travel, cutting-edge physics, and so on.

the fill each team with popular youtubers and and game devs (i think they've had the yogscast, notch, and robin walker each several times), with an invite-level medic on each team(i think).
georgia fans always gloom and doom when they lose an rb, never realizing that they've got 3 studs on the team that a lot of teams wish they had.
i suppose it also helps the banker to have a strong poker face, since we don't see them and we can't gauge their reactions to anything that is said.

i'd like to say he learned pretty damn quick
i was thinking it would suck to be the guy down below because the other guys ass is in his face.

my high school required that we take a year of a language in order to graduate, but you could only take spanish, french and navajo (i lived in the four corners close to the navajo nation).
