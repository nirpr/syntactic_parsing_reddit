he was a nice guy and all but you could tell by talking to him that in his youth he was just as backward as the rest of society.

the other huge turn off for me is if i can see that she's not terribly respectful to others, or seems like a bitch (we all have bad days, that doesn't give you the right to shit on other people.)

*how* you couldn't know that your tipper bed was up is beyond me, but i'm quite certain that no trucker voluntarily causes a major accident on a freeway that also could easily seriously damage the truck.

definitely feel comfortable saying that he's better than me

i agree with that, but dont' agree that it's not worth doing.

i'm sorry, i'd just rather figure out *how* that person has a cactus up their ass rather than admit that there may or may not be a *why* :'|

same, especially after you played so much with this character i thought that they would be a secondary character to represent the american side of the conflict.

i also understand that my habitual making plans for hypothetical scenarios and near-constant analyzing of myself and my situation is not normal behavior.

--------- there is a growing trend in the "manosphere" (if i'm permitted to say that without coming across as a dirty ess-jay-dubya) that marriage is a fundamentally broken contract that seeks to ensnare the hard-earned money of hapless men everywhere when women decide they're unhappy.

because a word sounds english to you, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's the only language that can claim it as its own.

now this isn't to say that they are the same thing, but that they take priority in different things.

oh, i didnt realize that it was an addictive substance.

i think we settled that it's about 50-50 and neither group knew that the other existed.

i was always told that the plant foot was the one touching the rubber.

well, since you've got the ball rolling, i'm gonna assume that you're skilled in bigotry.

it just so happens that it's always wrong.

reddit has this thing about reading some idiot on tumblr, and assuming that it is one of the core principles of feminism.

i hate that this is the world we live in, where children have to die, and people forget their civility on the sole basis that a person has different beliefs than they do.

i don't support pre-order bonuses any more than you, in fact i very much dislike them, but i've accepted that they are here to stay and if this was a real thing, i would absolutely put down the money in advance.

grown adults believing that a 2,000 year old carpenter from the middle east is the king of everything, died for everyone's sins, came back to life, and think that everyone should love him or else you will burn forever after you die.

i doubt that any car company would be willing to put out a public database of all its vehicles' flaws and how long they've persisted.

i would argue that "the very best" way to show that it's a unisex restroom for anyone would just be a sign that says "restroom".

lebron or kawhi or ad or dame or tatum or some fuckin body better make this man proud in the next few weeks by showing that there will be another mamba and pass 81

this will take you over 2,000 years to read a newspaper but i think we can agree that this is a manageable pace for just about anyone.

the economy sucks for people who don't have jobs, and i get that it's not as easy to find one as it used to be.

they may not be able to explain why, but on some level, they know that it's not good.

i am also bewildered by people who claim that it is “woman friendly”, and that the hijab is somehow “empowering”.

this means that it is very stable and has a lot of applications in its repositories.

i do think that i'd be happier if sexuality and sexual urges weren't part of my life.

i find it hard to believe that someone on earth is so stupid.

so you're saying that his statistical 1 in 4 chance of raping someone else before he turns 33 _does not_ qualify as quite high to you?

that means that it would be possible for all teams to end up on 123 points at the end of the season.

i hate that it's the only viable choice in that talent line though, but at least blizz noticed.

rick murdering dexter is a crucial event showing that this is now a completely different world (the dialogue between rick and tyrese pretty much says that later on).

at first i kinda disliked the headlights, but now i actually feel that this might be one of the most beautiful cars i've ever seen (accompanied by cars like the f40)

at this point it's likely to the point of functional certainty that we can **not** trust several members of congress.

ceo's can get distracted by things like that and think that "a computer is a computer", not understanding that they are two completely different platforms.

if i'm going to be meeting a terrible fate, i'd prefer that it's from dysentery.

i do agree that it can be very boring for pve.

i completely disagree that there would be any benefit to bringing mourinho in now.

i just tend to think that our standard "star trek" view of aliens is a bit misguided.

i post literally all day long, but i still think that i might be a bit tough to pin down- i'm an askwomen mod so i'm constantly giving dating advice/talking about gender stuff.

but yes, i think that our world series odds are far lower than 2-3%

i saw this and forgot that it was a writing prompt for a second, i got really excited that this was a real thing

i'm an atheist and i agree with all of this, but i can't help but notice that your "definition" isn't really a definition.

but imho the worst thing about it are the total silence from gw; it have been a month now and they have not even acknowledge that it's a problem (or working as intended)

the coach will say that what he was doing wasn't dissent, and you calmly explain that dissent is the act of openly disagreeing with your decisions, and invite him to look the word up if he likes.

i agree that it wasn't worth complaining about online, especially giving it a one-star review.

i don't think anything that requires you to install something on your pc should qualify at all, because unless it's open source and the community vets it, it is very hard to trust that it's not malicious.

as a prank they picked up his pet bird “reggie” and placed peanut butter on his “two inch punisher” the bird gobbled it up mohammed thought it felt odd but as a virgin guessed that it must be like this and wasn’t too bad.

as a genetics expert, i can tell you that rejection is naive.

as i've gained a little more life experience i've come to see that it is probably somewhat of a human tendency to see yourself as a victim, i'm sure i do it also.

although this wouldn't bother me, a hyphenated name would reveal that we are an interethnic couple because we both have surnames that can easily be traced to their respective cultures of origin.

no one seems to remember that the *reason* he chose osu over ttun is because they flipped another rb commit after he had been lead to believe that he was going to be their only recruit.

yeah, and i get that it's unavoidable that such a thing will happen.

that implies that this was back when mac mice still had one button.

and since you didn't let us know whether you ate a lot and took care of yourself properly while on it, i will safely assume that your body is **very tired**.

most people only see two sides in this issue but the nfl is finally learning that they can be a third ‘neutral’ side.

and i know that we are "seamlessly match-made" but have you seen anyone actually disappear and notice their departure?

i believe that common practice in this case is to take a pretrained model on generic images, and strip off the last few layers.

sure, but gandhi knew that his adversary was a "civilized culture", not a barbarous dictator with a penchant for murdering political rivals and dissidents.

i do agree that he's very versatile, and there's no true wrong way to build him.

he's well past where the engineer bullshitted that the car was so he can damn well speed up.

i was gonna say that that's a pretty cheap meal.

i think we can all agree that the “ashamed to be indian” part is the cringey aspect of this.

i agree it's not a big deal, but i also agree that it's big enough of one to warrant removal.

i'm not indicating you are, i was just merely commenting that it was an older engine, which means it's going to have less problems, and respawn didn't have to build a new engine from the ground up.

i love having him on the squad, but he isn't going to beat out eriksen for the attacking mid spot, and he hasn't shown that he can be effective on the wings.

i have every intent to remain unavailable, because the term "single" implies that i am ready and waiting.

but then again we have established that you're a liar.

his rationalisation about the necessity of religion makes me think that he is.

a friend of mine said that it might as well be ~50w if i underclock the cpu and setup the power saving options correctly.

and the divers who could knew that it just wasn't worth the risk.

but then again, how would you know that it's a common thought?

i'm saying that it's bad form to not even open dialogue with the parties involved first, before inviting the whole sub to weigh in.

although i agree that her booking/character in 2019 was patchy and uninteresting and she's kind of a pill in shoot interviews.

[knowing that it wasn't you that suggested the opposite]

she also said that she was willing to pee herself, which was amusing.

(its okay i can say that i'm a freemasonjewlizard myself) /s?

just wait for the public beta - and remember that it'll be buggy

i'm not saying that what they report is invalid - either partially or completely - just that i was interested to find out who owned the site and that they had taken steps to be anonymous.

yeah, fox has been having people on lately insisting that it's a headlock, not a choke.

the man said that that would be the one you wanted.

wait until you find out that in the books jack reacher is really tall, but tom cruise who played him is really short.

he does seem like he's willing to learn at least, and his very specific first plan also indicates that he's not half as stupid as the others mentioned in here...

yeah, it's like complaining that pruno isn't as good as a nice pino noir.

i read your post and agree with part of it but feel that my adding my ancestry added to the discussion on ancestry (the post was about ancestry in new england).

i'm just letting people know that these are mass-produced items.

which is still pretty unrealistic, that everyone will and charlie speak to suddenly accepts to throw aside gigantic profits, pre-existing (and *valid*) opinions, safe careers, and so forth, and come around to their side.

not to mention that he's a smuggler who dealt with all kinds of people, so it's unsurprising that he picks up on people's accents quickly.

your comment made me wonder about this, so i just asked /r/askeurope this question and of the four southern european countries that responded, three say that it's common there, or at least not unheard of.

i don't get all the people saying that it's extremely hard to type notes on an ipad and students should get a laptop or a keyboard for their ipad.

either he changes and you stay with him or he doesn't and you leave, just as long as you aren't keeping quiet or letting him think that it's acceptable behavior.

it was cool to pass through the fortifications into the town and see that everything was still in use.

how the times have changed since then and that it's easier to come out when you know it'll be taken seriously and nobody will give you shit for it.

seriously, i get that we're like "yeah yeah loria sucks" but you're also pretty fucking stupid if you think a team's gonna seriously be like "yeah all tickets are 61% off."

my step-sister had an re (religious education) teacher tell her that he-man was satanistic.

somehow or another i missed that your original comment was within the context of actual kids using this site.

of course not, i'm only showing that his political beliefs may have been a factor in him posting that misleading video.

being able to nail together some planks and make it stand for ~10 years is all you need to prove that you're a real man.

if you can't even tell that it's marketing, is it really disruptive to the sub?

i'm surprised tho, i heard that there "could" be some fake le fleurs, but i'm even more surprised there's a fake market for fake golf/tyler merch.

its more than a day old, the existence of your comment makes me think that you are weird not the content of the comment.

depending on who you were backstabbing (and assuming that they're at full health), you would need 3-7 backstabs in a 20-second interval to reach the 800 damage for 15% crit chance.

and then you see the rounded back of the turret and see that it isn't a box...

the other comedians start cracking up and immediately declare that this is the last podcast.

and i get to reply that it is the integrated graphics of my cpu.

i don't believe that he's an impostor.

i'm no economist, but you would think that putting money in the hands of the poor (and middle class) would be better for the economy because they will and have to spend it.

silly ameritard don't you know that you are racist dirty religious pig filth?

don't you dare ever think that you're weak for living with ra and choosing not to do something.

well i hope that it is a challenge.

i think he'd just assumed that canada was like rural north dakota (or something).

marathon minotaur i️ don’t know that anyone will be able to top them.

i just see one dude going "don't be cunts, people" and others agreeing that it is not funny (the comparison was, imo), and one thread of one guy remarking on her gravity, followed by deleted posts.

i actually read somewhere, unlike anything published for bush, that john glenn's iq is around 132-136).

they need to prove that they're special.

ignorant people may very well support donald trump but to suggest that his base is only white nationalists and russian bots is *kind of* why people are starting to doubt democrats.

the more i think about this entire debacle, the more i'm inclined to believe that it was all about the money.

i took a bit to think about it, and i realized that my actions and attitude were not always in the right place.

i read that it was actually a 2-week-old prototype.

- you want them to accept that you are an adult, relinquish control of your finances, and cooperate in getting you to a better school.

but i stated that i was also decent at quick scoping in this game despite being shit at quick scoping in general

i'm not disagreeing with you, but that one is probably more intentionally messy.

she confirmed that it is a similar feeling.

i mean, yeah, 99.99% of cops out there don't do any of this, but that 0.01% is enough to cause this kind of thing to come up.

with this information i'm inclined to say that this is a scam.

but 30 secs of airtime costs money, and i guess someone decided that it would be redundant to show people saying bye all the time.

i mean, if you pay closer attention you realize that he has been extremely not transparent, and reneged on quite a few promises....but the average person doesn't know about that, or even is likely to care.

i was assigned "feminist" at birth, but as i got older i realized that it was really just the ~~matriarchy~~ patriarchy forcing me into one of their gender roles, and that a misogynist is who i really am.

in fact i would speculate that woodwinds would be harder given that we use more keys and there fore have more complex hand motions (requiring more physical coordination).

first, we need to listen for connections from our server, but we need to know that they are from our server.

i must confess that i am at the far reaches of my astrophysics knowledge here.

shank's thing feels more like a retcon of explaining what he did when oda likely just tried to say that shanks was very strong willed

a psychiatrist reading this and thinking that he may actually be a danger to himself or other can have him committed.

eventually, he's going to learn that people will be more receptive and he learn more from the new culture of he adheres to some of these customs.

i get that it's an important piece of feminist literature, but the whole driving point of the book is that you're supposed to sympathize for edna, which is hard to do when she's a mean dumbass.

i try to argue that it's education, parenting, etc etc, but i was aware of general nutrition facts when i was a teenager.

although keep in mind that this will be the base model.

oh definitely there are the silent veterans, and i'd even go as far as to say that the majority of older veterans are the silent type.

they have to have been insisting that they're female for years.

it signifies that you were wrong and that your original statement was profoundly ignorant of canadian history.

i really like that their os is very close to standard aosp, but with just a few tweaks.

i think it is much more complicated that just favouring paying players or whatever.

i get that he was politically unpopular and had to staff his cabinet with the few fellow travelers he felt he could trust, but they don't do him any favours.

i can tell that you are in an enormous amount of pain, and given your position, it makes complete sense.

i appreciate that they're in chicago which is an easy drive to get to compared to mn or mi.

i'm not american but i think i once read (somewhere on the internet) that in the us, you're more likely to get asked for id than you might be in other countries, just to be on the safe side.

where in her original post does it say that this is a more important issue to her than poverty or starvation?

i imagine they would asset that it's a separate product from the windows os, and they'd be right.

we all want to feel that our fears are realistic.

it looks old and i don't think the animations were every modern but you will be sucked it, finish the game and if you are like me then say that it's the best game you ever played.

i like that he's the middle ground, he reviews shows that are worth watching but not as in depth as digi, but still far more organized and academic than most animetubers.

i can imagine that they can be an interesting challenge when you have some experience, but in your first playthrough when you have no idea what they're about it's just unfair.

i hope that it's not just cross gen and is also cross console transferring.

i'll start off by saying that they were great, unfortunately their opening act ruined the entire show.

"exempt" means that your job is exempt by law from the law that requires the department to cease all government functions when there is no funding.

spider-man's super speed and his spider-sense mean that it would be nigh impossible or batman to even connect in a really dangerous way.

while it's obvious that lotad was shiny during the research event, i figure there's no harm in confirming that it's still shiny, i found this lotad in the wild the day after the event.

i would've thought that this was a myth, but i had a buddy who was on the freshman team in high school who got to scrimmage with the varsity.

this is very true, i understand that it's a tough time for pm players (i don't play pm myself, but that's neither here nor there) but it has ~~nothing~~ *an extremely small amount* do to with this controversy.

that's actually what i had recommended (the i5), but he insisted that it wasn't worth the extra money to invest in despite my best efforts.

i'm hoping that it's interesting enough that you'll allow it.

and i'll be more likely to watch her in the future, but i accept that i might be in the minority on that, and i'd completely understand not taking the chance, in her shoes.

i heard that this was possible but it never happened in any of my games.

for a politician, money towards re-election is perhaps even more important than personal pocket money, and so it's not unreasonable to assume that they're beholden to those funding them.

maybe it'll be a pretty awesome seduction scheme to get a dress on and see how long time it takes for him to realise that you are bare underneath?

additionally, being a professional is not banned in the sidebar, it just says that it "likely isn't a 'hold my beer' moment", not that it definitely isn't.

yea i didn't mean that they can both be #1, that just wouldn't make sense obviously.

i'll allow that it definitely wasn't the movie i'd have made, but it isn't anywhere near as bad as people make it out to be.

you linked it here before you have: - documentation - example usage - the goal of the project i gather that it's a php framework that is designed to work with stripe api calls?

being from wisconsin, i love that i'm not the only one that noticed :3

i was really hoping that your new year tradition was a bowl of soup, so you started one in 2018 and finished one in 2019, and the same in 19/20

remember that you are the professional and the expert in this situation, and don't cede that ground.

or do you only think that the government is able to impose consequences on people?

it also says that it's a rant of partially finished and incomplete posts fused together into a single piece.

we can both agree that op is a tool.

this sub can be incredibly toxic - and i'm sure if you ask big n devs, many of them will say that their jobs aren't what they expected.

he sailed right past their fishing boats, and they didn't even acknowledge that he was there.

just typed out a long response about my experience with aortic dissection, only to realize that it was more for my own catharsis than to add to the discussion here.

now imagine taking that stick and without changing its angle running really really fast straight east, at the speed the earth is turning so it keeps being noon (for simplicity, ignore that the earths' axis is at an angle, or rather assume that it weren't.

i admitted that you were right in your argument.

i haven't until just now... did you know that you're in a dream?

i completely understand that it was her own preference, but the fact that i was rejected for something i can't control taught me the all-important lesson that life isn't always fair.

i think only yaya and modric are comparable, and i would argue that özil is better.

you have to let him know that you're not as comfortable.

i know you were trying to be condescending and snarky, by "dissecting" my silly joke and "correcting" it, all the while using the grammatically inappropriate question marks to imply that what you were saying was so obvious that **i** was stupid that you had to point it out.

i would propose that it's not 'just for living', but rather, for allowing the naturally existing opportunities one *could* be working with to be used more efficiently by machines instead.

(if i explained that we'd be here for a few paragraphs.)

at no point are you supposed to think that it isn't a movie you're watching.

he didn't say that her friendship isn't valuable, he simply insinuated that he wants more.

i see that it's a coop card game.

you're exaggerating if you say that it's the only difference.

but since eljoebro mentioned that he isn't good with money, locking it someplace safe would prevent him from simply spending it willy-nilly.

clearly a lot of people here--including myself--agree that it was a shitty move on wn's part.

honestly i think anyone will be hard-pressed to convince me that not only were sherman's tactics necessary and effective, the man himself showed extraordinary discretion and (dare i say) mercy in what could've been (or was, according to southern propaganda, gone with the wind, etc.)

this kid has shown that he's a big leaguer over the past couple weeks.

prove that i'm not.

i'm assuming that this will also be the ipad 5 announcement as well--it only makes sense.

but if you're (legally) making a wide left and there's a person to your left, in a left-turn-only lane, who suddenly decides to go straight, knowing that they are there will not help you avoid them.

yea, that's why i don't particularly care that they aren't quite up to standards entirely.

i know from experience though that based on buying used hondas, the amount we are able to deduct is quite a bit larger than our actual expenses.

during wwi, there were a lot of diseases that went around in the trenches, and it was discovered that circumcised men were less apt to get them, the assumption being that because they were unable to properly bathe, the foreskin acted as a nesting ground for viruses and bacteria.

i will fully admit that it's a fan theory with nothing to back it up, beyond personal interpretation, but i can't see any other reason for it beyond, "rowling didn't give a damn about internal consistency as long as she conveys what she wants."

australians fear that their cultural identity is under attack.

every time i mention "next week" on a sunday, i'm referring to tomorrow and beyond, not a week from then; i then realize that this isn't technically true, and it surprises me.

i agree that it is outrageous that a poor theoretical employee making only $7.25/hr in nyc should have even one thousand, let alone over three thousand, taken from them.

you realize that it's been your dream to own one and quickly point your camera at the pokemon, not knowing that the mother and her child in front of you are shocked that you're "taking their picture".

ha, not sure what it means that i was immediately like, "oh yes, that joke reference about hillary back from the 2016 campaign season"...

england fans ignoring that their players are diving.

dude it's my birthday i've got a game in excited to play coming out that i've been ready to play for awhile.

neither does you saying that it is russian.

they said it was against the spirit of the secularism of the state and i would say that most of the province was in favor of that judgement.

so, i just read that it's actually *not* illegal in most states, but le may pull you over for reckless driving or distracted driving.

they knew that i was infamous for parading around in shorts and a hawaiian shirt during the winter, with no issue.

people should already know that it's just a bunch of rocks in a circle.

i mean i agree that it is very suspicious, but cosby is a big target and you can't rule out the possibility (though seemingly improbable) that he is innocent.

where’s he saying that this is sustainable for all farmers?

i agree that it's that halsey is a huge hypocrite as well.

considering that the lack table is only 50x50, on the **outside**, i guess 60x60 should do the trick?

yea i didn't get that he was a student when i wrote that @.

i thought i had heard that it was the opposite.

he plays very confidently because he knows that there will be questions he knows the answer to at some point.

so not only do i insist on being right when i am right, i'm also willing to admit that i'm wrong when i am wrong.

i bet all women who've been assaulted or harassed look back and think that they were stupid, they did something wrong, they could have fixed it.

they admit that they're sorry if you were offended.

i hear what you're saying man, but just so we're clear: you mention that you were 'oldest of the two'.

i seriously believe that he will be an object of adoration, if not outright worship, well into the future.

i think he's trying to imply that giving the other team turnovers is more harmful than having just a low qbr

i don't mean to imply that you are one.

what about social media points you to think that they're still a student?

you absolutely can argue that you were not in the right frame of mind to be understanding forms during an emergency situation.

does that mean that all of society is “straight” save for little pockets like cap hill in seattle and the castro in san francisco?

does that mean that capitalist health care is wannacrypt or cryptolocker?

i'm assuming that you're british because of your phrasing.

you're automatically assuming that they *must* be mentally ill *because* they want suicide, that's the problem.

if you've ever used scented bleach you'd know that it's damn near impossible to discern between two different scents because they both just smell overwhelmingly of bleach.

i like that *repentless* was the final tribute to hanneman after *world painted blood*, and that slayer have decided that that's enough.

not to mention that her spread is so terrible that zarya's effective range with primary fire is actually a lot longer.

it just so happens that the other side of the river is missouri, and the missouri side eventually outgrew the kansas side.

actually, it's already been decided that that is what she is going to do

answer to your first question is yes,i can't help that i'm male and i love cock and cock turns me on!

in order for anything trump did to be illegal, you'd have to believe that it is wrong to investigate (or ask others to investigate) a possible political rival.

when i put my email adress and choose the country of residence, i complete the recaptcha, i agree that i'm older than 13, i click continue and it just says at the top "there was a problem creating your steam account, please try again later.

i mean, the polls show that he's right.

i imagine that our ancient ape ancestors weren't as interesting in fucking flat chested monkeys

would stand to reason that one should be white.

me and my buddy’s youtube channel hit 500,000 subs so we figured that this was the best way to celebrate with his sw 500 magnum

he asked some friends whether 'that was even a possibility' or not and they confirmed that it isn't to their knowledge.

the reasoning was meaningful as you said, but i was hoping that the actual location would be better.

i saw reports saying that jeb bush was about to fall by the time trump overtook him in the primaries.

i strongly hope that something like that is the case.

i mean i even asked him if it offends him that russia is often even the bad guy in video games (like red alert for example) but no, nobody there gives a fuck.

just remember that they are the silly ones though, for they apparently have a lot of nothing to say, so much nothing, in fact, that they are more than happy to size it all down to two words for you!

geez, there are still people trying to argue that the economic collapse was a result of the community reinvestment act?

edgelords know that what they post isn't socially acceptable, and don't genuinely believe what they say either, e.g.

recognize that this is his wedding day.

i don't know how this could happen, maybe massive grade inflation, but i highly doubt that this is the norm.

if she was attractive enough to me that we're already about to have sex, i won't care that she's trans.

he just figured that slave revolts might be less common if slaves were somewhat happy.

that being said, nintendo has stated that they were interested in remaking majora's mask, if there was enough fan support of the idea.

there was cut dialogue saying that it was just a nickname for the material that stuck.

he messages me again saying that he's ready to die (here we go again).

i don't know the answer to this question (and /u/rtiger's response is really insightful), but i definitely agree that it is not a worthwhile time for trading!

you realise that it is possible to think that someone is an arsehole and accept that they have done the right thing when they do.

edit: to clarify, i meant that it's only been i the last ten or fifteen years that i've seen ten-pin.

i think they both show off that it's not all "ray guns and space aliens" science fiction.

i agree that it can be confusing, especially when it’s an image taken through a mirror.

i realized that i was unhappy being skinnyfat, and i wanted to look good naked, so i started lifting weights (i read a book called starting strength by mark rippetoe).

i have also tested it out at the local dealer who let me test it out there to confirm that it was my table and not anything else.

it is not impossible to empirically show that you are wrong, but if it were, that would also mean that you are in no position to make your argument with any degree of certitude.

if the main choices are awful why is it wrong to express that i'm engaged and dissatisfied and not apathetic?

i just know that he was pretty bad all last season.

i was never told that they were jewish and i made a couple jokes about the holocaust, they didnt like that

i hate that everything is degradable nowadays.

i am extremely glad to hear that you weren't able to go through with that plan, and that your life's improving.

it took me a few minutes to get my wife to understand that it was completely insane for her to purchase such a machine.

i don't mean to nudge anyone to the side, it just seems that some of the grump side project are not the sort of thing we'd be fully aware of.

i think that saying that they are direct analogues is what this argument relies on and i think that that is actually a very questionable statement indeed.

i like that she's always interesting, devious, and moves the plot forward by fucking shit up.

i find it hard to believe that it could without the pin being under pressure from the spring and with nothing holding the shell in place but the little ejector hook.

you don't know, but i'll suggest that it's the main avenue for this sort of thing.

but i suspect that, when it's all wrapped up, there will have been a point to it all.

because a lot of the cmas-people i talk to insist that this is the best and safest way to do deep diving, which is probably what bugs me the most.

as someone who works in a preschool, i have found that it's possible live you're entire life with out using a single "don't", "no", "stop", ect.

given that rather depressing speculation, i say that this is probably the best way to end top gear.

you've probably noticed that popcorn is a bit more expensive at the movie theater.

i'm not complaining about your liberal use of the sub, i'm bitching that i'm on it way too much.

i didn't know that the linmon was hollow..

it’s kinda funny to me that china is such a shitty overlord that they’re nostalgic for the colonial days.

i feel that something like primecoin would be ideal for very short/quick/cheap transactions (day to day sub $100 purchases)...and can't find any other alt-coins that fill this niche.

i wasn't saying that it was illegal to defend yourself, i was just saying that it shouldn't be the root of the argument.

either case implies he thinks that her breaking up with op was the right call.

i suppose his parents could have bought him in and then paid for all of his grades while somehow preventing anyone from finding out about a serious disability, but occam's razor suggests that he's probably capable of reading at an adult level.

i still don't think that honking after the fact was the right thing to do.

i suspect that "death grip" isn't nearly as common or as easy to develop as people think it is.
